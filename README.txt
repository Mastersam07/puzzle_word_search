I found this puzzle as part of the lifleine bulletin so i decided to write a python program to solve it.

sheet1.txt contains the original crossword puzzle which i typed into the text file.
find.txt contains the list of words to  be searched for
found.txt contains words from find.txt as they are in sheet1.txt

While using this program make sure your found.txt file is empty so as to enable the found words to be placed here.
Feel free to try this program with other puzzle....
Enjoy!
